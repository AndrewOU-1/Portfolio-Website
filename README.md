# Portfolio-Website
A website built using *ONLY JavaScript. By using only JavaScript I mean creating ALL elements THROUGH JavaScript, 
that means <h1> tags, <div>s, <p>s, styling with CSS, etc.

You can see in both html files they each call the js file which writes all of the HTML and CSS.

This was a fun project inspired by a friend when I was discussing creating a portfolio website, 
but he challenged me by saying, "Oh why don't you make it all in JavaScript, just start with googling how to make an <h1> tag in JavaScript." 
And now we have the final project.


Most of the .js files are MESSY, and some methods used could be much cleaner in the future, but overall I learned a plethora of JavaScript AND HTML and CSS along the way.
Doing this project I gained a great understanding of basic JavaScript, and a suprising amount of HTML and CSS since I needed to create and style those elements via JS.
